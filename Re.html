<h2>LIBRARY MANEGEMENT SYSTEM</h2>
<p><h3>DESC:</h3><h4> LMS is a computerized system which helps user(librarian) to manage the library daily activity in electronic format .It reduces the risk of paper work such as file cost ,file damaged and time consuming. It can help user to manage the transaction or records more effectively and time saving</h4></p>
<h1>MAIN PROJECT:</h1>
<h2>CONTRADICTION BASED GRAY-HOLE ATTACK MINIMIZATION FOR AD-HOC NETWORS</h2>
<h3>DESC:</h3> <h4>We all know that providing the protection of ad-hoc networks (like MANETs,VANETs etc) which is exisit but which the dropping rate gray-hole attack)is minimized in a small amount compared to the project which we have done .In our project we proposed a method for minimizing the gray-hole DoS attack is to assumes that no explicit node collaboration with each node using only internal knowledge gained by routine routing information by using some of the protocols this result shows that decreases the gray-hole attack 51%</h4>
